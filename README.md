# Recipe page 🥗
This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge.
The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code
implementation is my own.

## The Process
First, I reviewed the provided design and analyzed the layout to plan my workflow and decide where to start.

I began by creating the HTML file and building the basic page structure. I added all the content that would be displayed on the page and wrapped it in appropriate HTML elements. I also used semantic HTML tags to improve the structure and readability of the markup.

Next, I created a separate CSS file and connected it to the HTML document. At the beginning of the styling process, I applied basic global styles such as box-sizing: border-box to make further layout work more convenient and predictable.

During development, I focused on keeping the code clean and well-organized. For spacing, I mainly used top margins to avoid issues with margin collapsing.

While working on the lists, I encountered a question about how to style list markers and change their color. After researching this topic, I learned how to use the ::marker pseudo-element, which allowed me to customize the list markers according to the design.

Finally, I continuously compared the page with the original design and added small improvements to make the layout and styles as close to the mockup as possible.

## What I Learned

- How important it is to analyze the layout before starting development
- How semantic HTML helps keep the structure clean and understandable
- How to set up base CSS styles for more predictable layouts
- How to style list markers using the "::marker" pseudo-element
